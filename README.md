## Description
We conducted a follow-up study to examine changes in saliva microbiota composition among 440 adolescents in the Finnish Health in Teens cohort at ages 11.7 and 14.2, with stable weight and those with increased weight, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The core microbiota composition varied between two timepoints, with significant alterations in adolescents with persistent overweight or obesity. The microbiota remained stable in adolescents who were previously normal-weight, even if they gained weight. Our findings suggest that saliva microbiota changes during adolescence, especially in those with persistent overweight or obesity.
